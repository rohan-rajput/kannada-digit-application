# kannada-digit-application

### This project is similar to the MNIST image classification project but with handwritten Kannada numerals. The dataset has been made possible by Vinay Prabhu and can be accessed on Kaggle. This image dataset consists of 70,000 images for the training set and 5000 images for the test set. The model chosen for this multiclass classification is a CNN (convolutional neural network) and the goal is to accurately classify the images into one of ten classes/labels.
